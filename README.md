# Challenge 06 - Weather Dashboard

##  Description

The weather dashboard allows the end user to look up the weather conditions for any city around the world. It presents them with the current and future conditions for the city they search for. Additionally, it keeps track of which cities they have searched for so they can search for the weather conditions again with the click of a button. 

My goal from the start was to use Bootstrap to style the app. This gave me plenty of exposure to the framework and I feel more comfortable using it than I did previously. It also gave me the opportunity to implement modals and learn how to use them more in depth.

The weather data is coming from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). Retrieving the data wasn't difficult, but understanding how the JSON data was structured was a bigger effort than I expected which led to having to rewrite my JavaScript code a few times.
